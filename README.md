Data Set Simulation of a Real World Phenomenon

Four variables were created using the numpy.random function. The variables chosen were:
age in years

1. Age 
2. BMI (18.5 - 25 normal:/ 25.1 - 40 Stages of abnormalities)
3. Diet (Salt intake, 1,500 - 2,300mg daily recommended)
4. Alcohol consumption (USA: Up to 4 units/day (56 g/day)(1.9 fl. oz./day), not to exceed 14 units/week (196 g/week)(6.6 fl. oz./wk)

To generate those number a research was done and the mean/average of the variables found in the research was used.
Mainly the project was based on results of the latest National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS 2011), that is considered a major investment in providing food consumption data of the adult population in Ireland.

After all the data was randomly generated, a histogram and a box plot were plotted for each variable. A data frame was created containing all the data and a pairplot was plotted based on nutritional status (overweight/obese).
